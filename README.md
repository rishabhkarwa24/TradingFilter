# TradingFilter
This project is not fully finished yet. However, the current implementation will allow you to run the project by running spy.py and then going to the stock_info.csv file to look at the current big cap stocks in the S&P 500 that are down for the day, with large institutional support. Please give this process 5-7 minutes, since the program visits about 750 websites during this timeframe. I am working on optimizing this part as much as possible.
The premise of this project is using institutional bets to your advantage when playing options or stocks, and buying the dips on these bigger cap stocks.
I am currently working on using a tree implementation to find stocks faster, if a person wishes to look at a certain company. Additional filters will be added once I find other websites that I can parse through, with well, backtested results.
Here are the current 6 month P/L results (+50%) of using my current filters (which I plan to automate using my filter): https://ibb.co/56wrR01
Enjoy!
